## What is a Forward Proxy?

A **Forward Proxy** acts as a middleman between a client and the internet.

### How it works:
- Sits between clients and the public internet.
- **Client-facing**: It primarily serves the client by forwarding requests to a server.

### Use Cases:
- **Access Control**: Block access to certain websites or restrict internet usage within a company.
- **Security**: Scan for viruses and block harmful content.
- **Monitoring**: Log usersâ€™ web activity (e.g., employee monitoring).
- **Content Filtering**
- **Caching**
- **Identity Protection**

## What is a Reverse Proxy?

A **Reverse Proxy** sits on the server side and handles requests from clients.

### How it works:
- Acts as an intermediary for client requests.
- Primarily serves web servers, sitting in front of one or more.
- Forwards incoming client requests to the appropriate server(s).

### Common Tools:
- `nginx` as a reverse proxy.

### Use Case:
- Load balancing across multiple backend servers.
- SSL termination (offloading SSL handshake from app servers).

## What is a Transparent Proxy?

A **Transparent Proxy** intercepts network traffic between a userâ€™s device and the internet **without modifying** requests or responses.

### Characteristics:
- Also called inline, intercepting, or forced proxy.
- No need for users to configure anythingâ€”**invisible** to end-users.

### Use Cases:
- Content filtering
- Traffic monitoring
- DDoS protection
- Authentication

## Why Use a Proxy for Load Balancing?

Using a reverse proxy for load balancing provides more **granular and flexible routing**, especially at **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**.

### Features:
- Route traffic based on headers, cookies, request content, etc.
- **SSL Termination** support
- Offloads CPU-intensive tasks like TLS handshake from backend servers

## Proxies vs VPN

> **Note**: A VPN is a specialized form of a forward proxy that includes encryption and operates at the system level.

## Why Use Proxies in Data Collection?

When making a large number of requests to a server from a single IP, you're likely to get blocked. Proxies allow you to:

- Send traffic using **multiple IPs** to avoid detection.
- Distribute requests to avoid throttling.
- Scale data scraping or API consumption efficiently.

## ðŸ”„ Quick Summary

- **Forward Proxy**: Used by clients to access the internet anonymously or securely.
- **Reverse Proxy**: Used by servers to manage incoming client traffic.
- **Transparent Proxy**: Invisible to clients, used for control and monitoring.
- **VPN**: Encrypted connection for full-device privacy and security.
